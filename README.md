# DS-CnRI ontology-based framework

DS-CnRI is an ontology-based framework which aims to facilitate the decision-making process regarding conservation and restoration (CnR) interventions for Cultural Heritage (CH), by assisting conservators to:
— organize the relevant information and determine requirements and criteria related to the decision,
— validate and enrich input information that is considered for the final decision (regarding the
conservation object, its environment, and the planned CnR intervention), and
— automatically receive a set of specific suitable as well as rejected intervention options for the
case at hand, which can be further explored in terms of their characteristics and limitations.

Information regarding the ontology and the framework have been published in:

1. The folder "Mapping rules" includes the rules which have been formulated using the MappingMaster DSL (O’ Connor, M. - Mapping Master [https://github.com/protegeproject/mapping-master]).
2. The folder "MS Excel Forms - Examples" includes examples of filled forms. The forms have been used for two different cases at hand according to the different stages of the framework
3. The folder "OWL Examples" includes examples of two different cases at hand and their results for the decision-making process.
4. The folder "SPARQL Queries" includes the different queries that have been formulated for the different stages of the framework.
